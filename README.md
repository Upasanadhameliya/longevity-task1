## Quick start for beginning

---

- # Basic settings

- First rename the file of remove postfix `.example` from `lg_api` folder and set your own config settings.

- Supported `Database`.
    1. Postgrages

# 1. ".ENV" environment

- The value of a variable is the first of the values defined in the following list:
    - Value of that variable in the .env file.
    - Value of that variable in the environment.
    - Default value, if provided.
    - Empty string.

    ``` shell
    CONFIG_PATH=${HOME}/.config/foo
    DOMAIN=example.org
    EMAIL=admin@${DOMAIN}
    DEBUG=${DEBUG:-false}
    ```

- At this point, parsed `key/value` from the `.env` file is now present as system environment variable and they can be conveniently accessed via `os.getenv()`:

``` shell
# settings.py
import os
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("EMAIL")
DATABASE_PASSWORD = os.getenv("DATABASE_PASSWORD")
```

# 2. Seeding a database is a process using seed command

 - Seeding a database is a process in which an initial set of data is provided to a database when it is being installed. It is especially useful when we want to populate the database with data we want to develop in future. This is often an automated process that is executed upon the initial setup of an application. The data can be dummy data or necessary data such as an initial administrator account.
 
```shell
python manage.py seed
```

# 3. Deploy project ngix (gunicorn)

- Where `WSGI_APP` is of the pattern `$(MODULE_NAME):$(VARIABLE_NAME)`. The module name can be a full dotted path. 

```shell
gunicorn -c setup.ini lg_api.wsgi
```
Note :  More information about `gunicorn` goto [here.](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/index.html)
